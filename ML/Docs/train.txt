Goal:
  parse a python file
  create execute.py to train the model in the docker
  create eval.py to evaluate the model in the docker
  create version.json from the version stated in the given python file
  
Note:
  this file should only be called by localEnv.js so keep these files in the same directory
  the files generated will be stored in the result.zip
  this file assumes that you are using keras based tensorflow 
  this file assumes that you have followed the styling guide found in styling.txt
  
Process:
  fileCont is a variable to store the contents of the file
  from the provided python file loop through each line
  for each line look for the style tags defined in styling.txt
    if ###tfVersion
      save the version listed to be later written into the json file
    if ###model
      save the name for the model to be used later on
    if this line is where the model is compiled and more than one gpu
      add a line before compiling to make keras run on each gpus
    if ###accuracy = 
      save the name for the accuracy variable
    if ###loss = 
      save the name for the loss variable
    else
      add the line to fileCont

  insert a line that saves the model to a model.h5

  insert a line that writes the accuracy and the loss to result.txt

  create version.json that will store the tensorflow version for use in localEnv.js

  create a file execute.py and write what is stored in fileCont to it

  reset needed values.

    if ###model
      save the name for the model to be used later on
    if this line is where the model is compiled and more than one gpu
      insert a line that loads the model.h5 file
    if ###accuracy = 
      save the name for the accuracy variable
    if ###loss = 
      save the name for the loss variable
    else
      add the line to fileCont

  insert a line that writes the accuracy and the loss to eval.txt
