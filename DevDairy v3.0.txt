This is the developers' dairy of BCAI_v3.0. Previously, the latest stable version is contract version v2.1, app.js version v2.1, which locates in gitLab folder.
The whole BCAI project is isolated from gitLab to make it clean and neat. Version is updated to v3.0 targeting at a stable ready-to-release demo. Contract and app version should all update align with the project version number. The folder in gitLab remains unchanged and deprecated. Developers should move to this branch.

The modification is like the following. 
1. [Important]: Some modules are renamed based on their current role in order to remove the confusion of naming and version.
    a. folder: bcai_v2.0 -> bcai_deploy     //NOTE: .gitignore file has updated with the new folder name.
                ML/files -> ML/examples     
                add ML/localWorker folder   //plan to add docker dependency to localWorker in order to remove the addtional install, have not applied this.
    b. files:  /bcai_deploy/contracts/bcai_2.0.sol -> bcai.sol
    c. ignore files: add ML/localUsers/result.zip to gitignore
                    add ML/localUsers/node_modules and same with lcoalWorkers
                add /bcai_deploy/client/build to gitignore, people are encouraged deploy new contracts. 
    d. Project version v3.0, contract v3.0.0, app.js v3.0.0



2. File code updates: ./bcai_deploy/contracts/bcai.sol
        a. Annoying wave line (Solidity plug-in's warning) is removed by adjusting the format of code. 
            Tailing whitespace are removed.
            However, assigning is remained to keep good-looking.
        b. IPFS is deprecated, so IPFS-related is renamed to Socket
        c. Deprecated comments are removed.
        d. line 328 around, explain the import popArray logic and issue.
        e. brief update notes added on top
        f. new .sol deployed successfully, test passed! tx : 0x5355dc83cead3e53978300239a21c18c8750510553d43b7bb321afe9e59b5b4b (ropsten)

    File code updates: ./bcai_deploy/client/src/App.js
        a. Add tempSocket to state declaration
        b. Add TODO in notification part
	c. Fixed the issue 
        **********************************************	
        /home/landry/Desktop/BCAI/ML/localWorker/localEnv.js:99
        let data = JSON.stringify(curState);

        by using the stringify safe, https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-stringify-safe
        add line : var stringify = require('json-stringify-safe');
        add package to npm $ npm install json-stringify-safe --save




3. Package the ML/localUser using npm init, added the dependency description to the package.json file.

4. Created the github branche release-v3.0-stable as archive branch. Any developing updates should be pushed to master*

5. TODO: add notification to a provider submitted his result, saying : you result has been submitted (and you need to keep socket.io running). 
    TODO: add notification for user what stage is his task.
    TODO: the task is completed, the final download is abnormal. In addtion, need to visualize the result somehow.
